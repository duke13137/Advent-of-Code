# Objective: write clojure code in src/aoc24/day##.clj to solve advent of code problem

## Instructions

1. read the problem from web link given from the chat input
2. there are two parts in each day's problem. solve part-1 first and then part-2
3. analyze example input and output to understand the problem
4. think algorithm to solve the problem first, then write code adhere to the **Output** section
5. use concise and informative names. make sure the code is readable and efficient.

## Output

```clojure

(def input (split-lines (slurp "aoc24/day##.txt")))

(defn part-1 [input]
  (-> ...))

(defn part-1 [input]
  (-> ...))

(def exmaple (split-lines "..."))

(part-1 expample)
(part-2 expample)
```
