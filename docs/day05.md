Okay, here's a concise breakdown of the problem and how to solve it, along with the specific example data:

**Problem:**

Given page ordering rules (X|Y means X must be printed before Y) and a list of page updates, determine which updates follow all applicable rules. For the correctly ordered updates, sum the middle page numbers.

**Example Data:**

**Rules:**
```
47|53
97|13
97|61
97|47
75|29
61|13
75|53
29|13
97|29
53|29
61|53
97|53
61|29
47|13
75|47
97|75
47|61
75|61
47|29
75|13
53|13
```

**Updates:**
```
75,47,61,53,29
97,61,53,29,13
75,29,13
75,97,47,61,53
61,13,29
97,13,75,29,47
```

**Solution Steps:**

1. **Parse Rules:**  Create a data structure (like a dictionary or list) to represent the rules.
2. **Validate Update Order:**
    - For each update, create a list of applicable rules, where applicable means both pages are present in the update.
    - Check if the update order respects all applicable rules. If rule X|Y is violated the update is incorrectly ordered.
3. **Sum Middle Pages:** For valid updates, identify the middle page number (handle odd and even lengths). Sum these middle pages.

**Example Walkthrough:**

- **Update 1 (75,47,61,53,29):** This update is valid. Applicable rules are the subset that include these numbers. Middle number is `61`.
- **Update 2 (97,61,53,29,13):** This update is valid. Applicable rules are the subset that include these numbers. Middle number is `53`.
- **Update 3 (75,29,13):** This update is valid. Applicable rules are the subset that include these numbers. Middle number is `29`.
- **Update 4 (75,97,47,61,53):** This update is invalid.  Because the rule `97|75` is broken.
- **Update 5 (61,13,29):** This update is invalid. Because the rule `29|13` is broken.
- **Update 6 (97,13,75,29,47):** This update is invalid. Multiple rules are broken.

**Result:**

The middle page numbers of valid updates are: 61, 53, and 29. The sum is 143.

**Summary:**

The task involves verifying update orders against given rules and summing the middle page numbers of only the valid updates.

Okay, here's a concise summary of the problem, keeping the example data:

**Problem:**

You're given page ordering rules (e.g., `47|53` means page 47 must come before 53) and a list of updates (sequences of page numbers).

**Part 1:**

1.  **Validate:** Determine which updates are in the correct order according to the rules.
2.  **Calculate:**  Find the middle page number of each correctly-ordered update. Sum these middle numbers.

**Part 2:**

1.  **Correct:** For the *incorrectly*-ordered updates, reorder the pages to comply with the rules.
2.  **Calculate:** Find the middle page number of each *corrected* update. Sum these middle numbers.

**Example Data:**

**Rules:**
```
47|53
97|13
97|61
97|47
75|29
61|13
75|53
29|13
97|29
53|29
61|53
97|53
61|29
47|13
75|47
97|75
47|61
75|61
47|29
75|13
53|13
```

**Updates:**
```
75,47,61,53,29
97,61,53,29,13
75,29,13
75,97,47,61,53
61,13,29
97,13,75,29,47
```
**Part 1 Result:** Correctly ordered updates are `75,47,61,53,29`, `97,61,53,29,13`, and `75,29,13` with middle numbers `61`, `53`, and `29` which sums to `143`

**Part 2 Result:** Incorrectly ordered updates are corrected to `97,75,47,61,53`, `61,29,13`, and `97,75,47,29,13`, with middle numbers `47`, `29`, and `47` which sums to `123`
